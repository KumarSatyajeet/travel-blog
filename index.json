The beach is located on the shore of Bay of Bengal and is approximately 16 kilometers from the Balasore Railway Station. Chandipur in Balasore is a unique beach where the sea recedes up to 5 km twice a day during ebb tides. During when the sea recedes, the beach turns into a biodiversity hotspot. You may also find lots of ghost red crabs, shells on the beach during ebb tide. The Chandipur coast has attained global popularity for its ‘Vanishing Sea’ phenomenon.

A one day bike trip to Hogenakkal waterfalls started early morning on 26th December 2020. Its almost 130 km from Bangalore and took 3 hours to reach the destination. You can enter the river from both Karnataka and Tamilnadu end(INR 750/-). It’s as if you have stepped into Paradise itself with swaying trees, clear skies, chirps of unknown birds floating into your ears, and the awe-inspiring natural beauty! The carbonatite rocks at Hogenakkal falls are the oldest igneous type of rocks found on Earth even before civilization! It’s not your fault if you confuse them with black marble especially when the waters glide down them shining orbs of black in the sunlight, looking no less than glistening onyx stones! The Kaveri at Hogenakkal cuts through numerous of these carbonatite rocks forming them into steps at various heights from where the falls come rushing down, creating a wide pool below. And if you want to visit the other side of the river (for example you entered from Karnataka side and want to go to Tamilnadu side of the river then it will cost INR 1000/- more). I would recommend my viewers to enter from Karnataka side. You will get to see more views and afterwards no need to go to Tamilnadu side. This is an awesome place to explore/sightseeing and a weekend gateway.\n8 people can be accommodated on the coracle while it gently floats on the Kaveri River, which will have you swaying as gently as possible on both the sides as the coracle moves forward. You can witness the glorious scenic beauty of lush green vegetation around you, the shy fishes in the water hiding as swiftly as they appear, while dipping your hand in the cold water, feeling the chill run through your body, hearing the mighty roar of the Hogenakkal falls along with the rumbling of waters of the Kaveri accompanied by the chirp of crickets. Once you close your eyes you can very well imagine yourself enjoying a serene boat ride in the rivers of some dense forest! Hogenakkal is a quaint little village in the district of Dharmapuri and is popular amongst visitors for the Hogenakkal Falls which gives a striking resemblance to the Niagara Falls! If you want to spend some peaceful time against the lap of nature, away from the mundanity of the city life, surrounded by vast vegetations of greenery wherever your eyes wander, along with the mighty sound of the Hogenakkal Falls then you are welcome to step into the land of this beautiful haven!\n","permalink":"https://kumarsatyajeet.github.io/travel-blog/blog/hogenkkal/","tags":["Travel"],"title":"Hogenakkal"},{"categories":["Puri"],"contents":"Puri is famous for the world famous Jagannath Temple \u0026amp; Longest Golden Beach. It is one of the Dhamas (Holiest of the holy place) out of four Dhamas i.e. Puri, Dwarika, Badrinath \u0026amp; Rameswar, in India. Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra and elder brother Balabhadra are being worshipped in Puri (The Purusottama Kshetra). The deities are seated on the Bejeweled Pedestal (Ratna Simhassana).   Shree Jagannath Puri Temple is one of the most impressing monuments of the Indian State Odisha, was constructed by a famous king of Ganga Dynasty Ananta Varman Chodaganga Deva dating back to 12th century at the seashore Puri. The main temple of Jagannath is an impressing and amazing structure constructed in Kalinga architecture, with a height of 65 meters placed on an elevated platform. The metal wheel at the top of Lord Jagannath temple is known as Neela Chakra (Blue Wheel). The wheel is made of eight metals comprising of iron, copper, zinc, mercury, lead, brass, silver and gold. It\u0026rsquo;s circumferance is about 36 feet and it is so designed that there is a wheel within the wheel. The circumferance of the inner wheel is about 26 feet. Eight hubs join together the inner and the outer wheels. There are decorative designs on the outer wheel. The thickness of the Neela Chakra is 2 inches.\nThe flag pole attached to the Neela Chakra is 38 feet long. After covering the breadth of the Neela Chakra, this pole extends 25 feet high above it. The figures carved on the outer circumference of the outer wheel are figures of eight Navagunjaras. In Hindu mythology the Navagunjara or Nabagunjara is a creature formed out of the parts of nine different animals and birds. All the eight Navagunjaras are facing towards the Neelachakra Flag. Patitapabana is a combination of two words, \u0026lsquo;Patita\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Pabana\u0026rsquo;.

As per history, to save the Jagannath Temple from destructions by the Muslim rulers, the Khurda and Puri King of that time Gajapati Ramachandra Dev-II (1732 to 1743 AD) married a Muslim girl under pressure of inadvertent conditions. By marrying a Muslim girl, the king had broken his religion and became a sinner. As per the temple rule, the King had inherent institutional right to worship Lord Jagannath as the Gajapati King. At that time the main concern of the temple priests was how to maintain this age old tradition. But understanding the king\u0026rsquo;s devoted faithfulness to Lord Jagannath, the Priests made an alternative arrangement to solve the problem and installed the image of Lord Jagannath on the right side wall of the main entrance of the temple for Darshan from Grand road by the King and also for all other Patitas who are not allowed to enter into the temple. Since that day Lord Jagannath is worshipped as \u0026lsquo;Patitapabana\u0026rsquo; at this place. While entering to Puri Dham, you will see this beautiful gate.

As such, when we got together this time, we planned a visit to the majestic mountain.

The heat in summers could turn out to be slightly exasperating while winters witnesses inundated trails. Mullayanagiri receives heavy downpours, and hence, the rainy season is also not a good season to plan your visit. The thick sheets of rain received here might blind you for the rest of your ascending journey. History: Once there was a saint named Tapasvi Mullapa Swamy.

In this manner, the mountain got its current identity.\nIn the early days, when the asphalt rock and concrete steps were totally absent, people used to climb the summit by a trail known as Sarpanadi or Sarpadari.
